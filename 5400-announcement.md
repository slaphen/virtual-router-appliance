# Vyatta 5400 End of Support Announcement
{: #vyatta-5400-end-of-support-announcement}

Support for the legacy Vyatta 5400 offering will end on March 31, 2019. This date is largely driven by the fact that the underlying Debian 7 software kernel that the Vyatta 5400 code is built on will no longer have Debian community support.

After March 31, 2019, the vendor for Vyatta 5400 (AT&T, who acquired the Vyatta product line from Brocade in 2017) will no longer provide any code patches or accept support escalations for the device.

Customers using the Vyatta 5400 should migrate to an alternative solution (such as the IBM Virtual Router Appliance (“VRA”; based on the Vyatta 5600) or the IBM Juniper vSRX offering) prior to March 31, 2019.   

As either of these alternative solutions requires a new configuration, IBM Cloud continues to offer a no cost Configuration Conversion service until June 15, 2019. For details of this service, or to request a conversion engagement, please send an e-mail to nwom@us.ibm.com, and state:

1. The name of the IBM Cloud customer.
2. IBM Cloud account number.
3. The contact information for the customer point(s) of contact authorized to send and receive configuration conversion documentation.           

For customers requiring assistance with “hands on” migration tasks, IBM Cloud has worked to identify qualified IBM Business Partners who can provide assistance. These engagements will be on a fee-based model, through a direct contract between the customer and the Business Partner.
